Rails app generated with [lewagon/rails-templates](https://github.com/lewagon/rails-templates), created by the [Le Wagon coding bootcamp](https://www.lewagon.com) team.
Project description goes here

This app was created as part of a student exercise for the Le Wagon Tokyo Web Development Bootcamp. The project was an AirBnB clone to design a website that specialized in clothes rentals.  Apparel owners can view and approve/reject rental requests.  Rentees can mark whether the rented item was successfully delivered.
